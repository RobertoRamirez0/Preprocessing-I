      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>21 year old web developer in training. I currently reside in upstate New York, about two hours from New York City.
        I studied computer science at my local community college, but soon learned that the traditional way of learning was not
        for me. I strive in hands on learning, I love to learn by doing. I'd like to think that I am a fast learner, I always keep 
        an open mind and welcome all ideas and criticism, which I believe has helped me not only with becoming a better student,
        but a better person overall. I am absolutely passionate about technology, ever since I rooted my first android
        phone when I was 13, a whole new world opened up to me. Ever since I have tried to dabble and experience anything to
        do with technology in all its applications. My ultimate goal is to become an innovator and create something that will
        positively affect the lives of millions, because I believe that everyone should have an opportunity to achieve their dreams.
